This is a story about Jake. Jake loves videogames, sometimes he plays so many that he never has time for other things! This is a big problem. 
Recently jake has decided that he wants to change this. So Jake decided to delete all his games! However, one of them refuses to be deleted properly, 
and Jake doesnt know what to do. Finally, Jake decides to reset his computer, but when he does, he is sucked into his computer, his fate unknown...

He opens his eyes. It is a normal morning, the alarm clock blaring as usual. Everything seems to be normal. But he soon realizes he doesn't remember 
how he got there. Despite the confusion, he forgets about it in his hurry to get ready for class on time. Grabbing his backpack and lunch, he heads 
out. But there it is in front of him: the sky is pixelated.

Jake rubs his eyes a few times, taking a moment to take in his surroundings and environment. Looking around, he sees wonders unlike anything the real
world has ever offered. Flying saucers, soaring through the sky, people using amazing abilities and powers to navigate and fight, all arranged in glorious
8 bit style. Jake shook his head, hoping to wake up. It was going to be an interesting journey...
